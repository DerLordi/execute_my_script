# execute_my_script
EXECUTE MY SCRIPT - This Extension will execute your saved JavaScripts. User your imagination

This Extension will help with reoccurring script that you have to execute in your browser console. 
You can write them and save them to a button. Now you dont have to open you console every time to execute some Javascript.

This was a huge timesaver on my part.
